## About
I build UI systems that stay fast, testable, and predictable — even as they grow. At Mycritters I built E2E suites and led SEO and generative engine optimization improvements, increasing pages indexed by 120%. While doing that, I managed a team of 7 developers with collaboration from the founder. At Solmi Solutions I architected app-wide state management system and refactored a MVP into a modular 41-component Vue architecture, cutting down on technical debt. At Skill Tree I helped engineer a notification system serving 10,000+ users, increasing user retention.
